## 47-1-Introduction
Why do we need service discovery?

Over time, we add more targets or we decommission(remove) some of them. Then we have to update prometheus.yml each time.
We don't want to do this. So if we're in a very highly dynamic env where servers are continuously, having to keep updating the configuration
is hard. That's where service discovery comes in.

Prometheus can keep track of all of the ec2 instances and other servers in cloud envs.

Sth we've been working with. This is one form of service discovery.
