# Section 2 - Observability Fundamentals

## 2-1 - Intro to Observability 0712
Without observability, our app is gonna operate like a black box. Some data goes in and some data goes out, we don't have any idea what's
going on inside.

Example of traces: At the gateway we're gonna have one span, at auth service we're gonna have another span and in user servie, another
span and ... .

Prometheus only handles metrics. It does nothing with logs and traces.
